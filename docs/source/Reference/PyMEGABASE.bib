            We introduce the Nucleome Data Bank (NDB), a web-based platform to simulate and analyze the three-dimensional (3D) organization of genomes. The NDB enables physics-based simulation of chromosomal structural dynamics through the MEGABASE + MiChroM computational pipeline. The input of the pipeline consists of epigenetic information sourced from the Encode database; the output consists of the trajectories of chromosomal motions that accurately predict Hi-C and fluorescence insitu hybridization data, as well as multiple observations of chromosomal dynamics in vivo. As an intermediate step, users can also generate chromosomal sub-compartment annotations directly from the same epigenetic input, without the use of any DNA–DNA proximity ligation data. Additionally, the NDB freely hosts both experimental and computational structural genomics data. Besides being able to perform their own genome simulations and download the hosted data, users can also analyze and visualize the same data through custom-designed web-based tools. In particular, the one-dimensional genetic and epigenetic data can be overlaid onto accurate 3D structures of chromosomes, to study the spatial distribution of genetic and epigenetic features. The NDB aims to be a shared resource to biologists, biophysicists and all genome scientists. The NDB is available at https://ndb.rice.edu.},

	abstract = {Using computer simulations, we generate cell-specific 3D chromosomal structures and compare them to recently published chromatin structures obtained through microscopy. We demonstrate using machine learning and polymer physics simulations that epigenetic information can be used to predict the structural ensembles of multiple human cell lines. Theory predicts that chromosome structures are fluid and can only be described by an ensemble, which is consistent with the observation that chromosomes exhibit no unique fold. Nevertheless, our analysis of both structures from simulation and microscopy reveals that short segments of chromatin make two-state transitions between closed conformations and open dumbbell conformations. Finally, we study the conformational changes associated with the switching of genomic compartments observed in human cell lines. The formation of genomic compartments resembles hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, with the aggregation of denser and predominantly inactive chromatin driving the positioning of active chromatin toward the surface of individual chromosomal territories.},

	abstract = {Chromosome conformation capture experiments provide a rich set of data concerning the spatial organization of the genome. We use these data along with a maximum entropy approach to derive a least-biased effective energy landscape for the chromosome. Simulations of the ensemble of chromosome conformations based on the resulting information theoretic landscape not only accurately reproduce experimental contact probabilities, but also provide a picture of chromosome dynamics and topology. The topology of the simulated chromosomes is probed by computing the distribution of their knot invariants. The simulated chromosome structures are largely free of knots. Topologically associating domains are shown to be crucial for establishing these knotless structures. The simulated chromosome conformations exhibit a tendency to form fibril-like structures like those observed via light microscopy. The topologically associating domains of the interphase chromosome exhibit multistability with varying liquid crystalline ordering that may allow discrete unfolding events and the landscape is locally funneled toward “ideal” chromosome structures that represent hierarchical fibrils of fibrils.},

	abstract = {In vivo, the human genome folds into a characteristic ensemble of 3D structures. The mechanism driving the folding process remains unknown. We report a theoretical model for chromatin (Minimal Chromatin Model) that explains the folding of interphase chromosomes and generates chromosome conformations consistent with experimental data. The energy landscape of the model was derived by using the maximum entropy principle and relies on two experimentally derived inputs: a classification of loci into chromatin types and a catalog of the positions of chromatin loops. First, we trained our energy function using the Hi-C contact map of chromosome 10 from human GM12878 lymphoblastoid cells. Then, we used the model to perform molecular dynamics simulations producing an ensemble of 3D structures for all GM12878 autosomes. Finally, we used these 3D structures to generate contact maps. We found that simulated contact maps closely agree with experimental results for all GM12878 autosomes. The ensemble of structures resulting from these simulations exhibited unknotted chromosomes, phase separation of chromatin types, and a tendency for open chromatin to lie at the periphery of chromosome territories.},
